Solid objects, by definition, have a specific shape. Look around! You may find cuboids, spheres, or any arbitrary potato-like :potato: shape. Do you also find objects that are much longer along one dimension than the other two. Didn't find any? Maybe look at one of your hair strand 💇‍♀️ ! Such objects are termed as slender structures and are called as rods/beams/columns (there's a slight difference between these terms but we shall ignore that for now). 

Rods are slender structures which deform in the three dimensional space. The deformation can be motivated by external actors 🎐 or by internal material reorgarnisation (termed as growth 🌱). In order to predict such deformations accurately, one makes use of rod theories. One such rod theory is the one proposed by Simo - it is geometrically exact! This means that the theory makes no assumptions about the deformation of the rod. The deformation can be arbitrarily large and in 3D. The more conventional ~~rod~~ beam theories such are Euler-Bernoulli or Timoshenko are valid only for small, 2D deformations and thus are geometrically inexact!

Rods are not just used as mundane objects in daily life (hair are important of course). One can make use of rods in a variety of applications. I will try to list some of them here:
