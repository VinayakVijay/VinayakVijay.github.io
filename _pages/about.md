hi there my friend! i am vinayak. I am interested in studying the behaviour of slender rod-like objects at continuum as well as nanoscale.

I am currently pursuing my PhD degree under the supervision of Prof. Ajeet Kumar (also my masters degree supervisor) and Prof. Prateek Gupta from the Department of Applied Mechanics, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Earlier, i obtained my MS(R) degree from the same department.
